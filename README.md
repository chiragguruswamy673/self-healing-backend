# 🧠 AI-Powered Requirement → Backend Generator

An autonomous AI system that converts **plain English requirements**
into a **production-ready backend codebase** with APIs, authentication,
database models, and project structure.

This project demonstrates how **AI agents can replace manual scaffolding**
and dramatically accelerate backend development.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Backend development often starts with:
- Repeated boilerplate
- Manual API planning
- Copy–paste architecture decisions
- Slow setup time

This project solves that by introducing an **AI-driven software delivery
pipeline** that:
- Understands requirements
- Plans backend architecture
- Generates clean, structured code automatically

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **Requirement Planning Agent**
- 🧱 **Backend Code Generation Agent**
- 🔐 **Authentication & JWT support**
- 🗄️ **Database models & CRUD logic**
- 🚀 **FastAPI-based production backend**
- 🐳 **Docker-ready architecture**
- 📂 **Clean project scaffolding**

## **Output**
- main.py
- auth.py
- models.py
- crud.py
- Dockerfile
- README.md

## 🧾 Example Input

```json
{
  "requirement": "Build an authentication service with user registration and login"
}
```
## 📤 Example Output
- main.py
- auth.py
- models.py
- crud.py
- JWT-based authentication
- REST APIs

## 🧠 How It Works
User submits a natural language requirement
Planning agent extracts:
- Entities
- Features
- API contracts
Code agent generates:
- API routes
- Models
- Auth logic
-Project structure
Backend is immediately runnable

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Backend- FastAPI
- AI Logic - Agent based architecture
- Auth	- JWT
- Database	- SQLAlchemy
- Language	- Python
- DevOps	- Docker 

## ▶️ Running Locally
```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## 🎯 Why This Project Is Special
- Generate snippets
- Lack structure
- Aren’t production-ready

This project:
- Designs backend architecture
- Generates complete systems
- Mimics real software delivery pipelines

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- LLM-powered code refinement
- Frontend generation
- Cloud deployment support
- Multi-service orchestration
